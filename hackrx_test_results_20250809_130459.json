      "question": "What is my flight number?",
      "answer": "To determine your flight number, follow these steps: 1. Call the endpoint `GET https://register.hackrx.in/submissions/myFavouriteCity` to retrieve your favorite city. 2. Use the provided tables to map the city to its associated landmark. 3. Based on the landmark, call the corresponding endpoint to get the flight number. For example, if your favorite city is \"Chennai\" and its landmark is \"Charminar\", you will call `GET https://register.hackrx.in/teams/public/flights/getFifthCityFlightNumber` since \"Charminar\" is not among the listed landmarks (Gateway of India, Taj Mahal, Eiffel Tower, or Big Ben). The final flight number will be returned based on the endpoint called."
